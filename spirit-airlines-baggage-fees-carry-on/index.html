<p>Are there fees for baggage on spirit airlines (nk)? Spirit typically charges $90 to cancel your reservation online and an even heftier $100 to cancel over the phone or at the airport. But with a checked bag you’d then need to hang around to collect at the baggage claim carousel and, of course, there is an increased risk of damage, theft, or loss of checked bags. It’s $32 for first checked bag, $42 for second checked. Spirit airlines is the leading ultra low cost carrier in the united states, the caribbean and latin america.</p>
