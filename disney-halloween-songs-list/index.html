<p>Isaiah griffin , rachel ham , tyler hoechlin , murray phillips votes: Enjoy these spooky, classic halloween songs. The hansen kids are in a jam. Some of the most memorable disney villains ever, including snow white‘s evil queen and sleeping beauty‘s maleficent, don’t get villain songs.plenty of others do, though—20, by my count. It includes the nightmare before christmas, disney villain songs, music from the haunted mansion, and even goofy and tigger singing some classics.</p>
