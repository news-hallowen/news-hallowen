<p>A 6 foot pvc pipe, which costs about $20 from rona. Chris minor of ashland, va., who is an engineer, took to facebook on sept. The couple designed a candy slide that was two metres long, meaning they can deliver sweets to visiting children without coming into contact with them. To make things even easier, i decided to pack my candy bags 1 month in advance, put them in “isolation” in a halloween ziploc style bag. Pre drill a hole into the pcv pipe and use a dremel to cut a hole large enough to get a screw into the bottom of the pipe.</p>

<p>Cut your 2×4 to the desired height, keeping enough of an angle on it to allow the candy to easily slide through. It features a full skeleton figure holding the upper end of the long. Kids are safe down there. The lower edge should sit just outside of the pumpkin’s “mouth.” hold the other end of the chute and slide candy down it! All you need to make this slide is a variety of pvc pipe and connectors.</p>

<p>The couple designed a candy slide that was two metres long, meaning they can deliver sweets to visiting children without coming into contact with them. Grab a gutter, or a pvc pipe, a long cardboard box, or a poster mailing tube and you�re on your to touchless candy delivery. A 6 foot pvc pipe, which costs about $20 from rona. On both stands, saw at a 20 degree angle to attach it to the pipe. Jaimie and jay brilliantly make the candy slide—which you can diy by watching this video—using pvc pipes, connectors, a hot glue gun, a hacksaw, scissors, and halloween decor.</p>
