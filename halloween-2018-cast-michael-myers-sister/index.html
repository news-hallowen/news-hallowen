<p>Laurie strode denkt nog dagelijks aan michael myers, de angstaanjagende moordenaar die haar in 1978 op halloween bijna om het leven bracht. Even as michael myers loomed over halloween night, it was hard to not be charmed by vicky. Unlike the original, michael is never unmasked in 2018�s halloween. Judith margaret myers was born to donald myers and edith myers on november 10, 1947 in russellville, illinois.her brother michael was born in 1957, and her sister cynthia was born in 1961. Even though the film never really explains why michael killed his sister, viewers have come up with some reasonably appealing ideas over the years.</p>
