Hide halloween treats in and around your house. Take a bunch of saran wrap, lay it out in long sheets, and then place your candy on it as you start to roll it up into a ball forming a multilayered candy orb contained inside one of those most annoying materials ever manufactured by the human hand.</p>

<p>Hold a halloween treat hunt with household members. Hold an outdoor costume parade or contest so everyone can show off their costumes. This year the simple act of trick or treating is a viral minefield, and as such people are making. Gently throw candy at costumed kids in their yards, like your car is a parade float. Roll it out to the tricker, fire off the air horn, and however much candy.</p>
