<p>I�m personally excited for the myers skin (going to down survivors with a screwdriver or a metal pipe :p) og ghost face suit &amp; the tapp set. Dead, daylight, dead by daylight, dbd, michael, myers, michael myers. New the twins skin leaked, props to the devs for this one 😍. Find derivations skins created based on this one; With michael myers and laurie strode being licensed characters it has me wondering if the cosmetics they can have will be very limited.</p>
