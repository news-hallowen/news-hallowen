<p>Pick a date and time that works for everyone, then send your invites virtually or by text. Usually played outdoors, ‘i spy’ works pretty well on a zoom call using the kids’ backgrounds as scenery.

<p>Separate everyone into teams of 5. The activities and games at these events tend to be halloween themed, and may include virtual trick or treat, spooky scavenger hunts, and online haunted houses. Don’t forget to plan a game that works for all ages attending your zoom call. And zoom is great for halloween celebrations too. All of the ideas below only use items that you already have around the house so there will be no other costs involved unless you want to buy small prizes for the winners.</p>
