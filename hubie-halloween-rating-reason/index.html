<p>The only reason i kept thinking that was just how unusual it was to be interested in this younger kid. Hubie halloween is an ameican horror comedy film which released on october 7, 2020, on netflix. But a first glance at the cast list or description will likely set you up for disappointment. Other members of the cast include kevin james, julie bowen and steve buscemi. Anyone who knows me knows i am not a massive fan of horror/ thriller films (although there is one or two which i have enjoyed) when i saw the trailer for hubie halloween i could tell it would be right up my street.</p>
