<p><strong>Adam Sandler Big Daddy Movie</strong>. Fans of sophomoric humor have made him a superstar. Here he conducts a clinic on how to corrupt a minor, then tries to redeem his character’s irresponsible behavior with drippy moralizing. Yet it�s a welcome return to the sweetness and heart of the wedding singer after the numbing dopiness of the waterboy, and the tasteless portions (about 90 percent of the film) are played in such a broad. They�ve been my favorite band since i was, like, twelve.</p>
