<p>Recreate this or you can add blood for a more gory look. When we were kids, we used to wear those plastic masks and basic crayons to draw attention on halloween, but those are past things. You can say it’s one of the most traditional ways with halloween costumes too. All the words related to makeup have the word “art” in them for instance, makeup artist &amp; makeup art. The feeling is definitely halloween inspired!</p>
